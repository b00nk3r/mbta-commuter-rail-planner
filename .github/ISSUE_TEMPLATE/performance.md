### Overview
Describe the performance problem and why it matters (user impact, costs).

### Scope
- Affected code paths/components (paths)
- Data sets/endpoints relevant to testing

### Implementation details
- Baseline metrics: 
- Target metrics: 
- Proposed techniques (memoization, batching, pagination, indexing, etc.)

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Measured improvement meets target metrics
- [ ] No correctness regressions

### Testing
- How to measure (tools, steps, data)
- Include before/after measurements and methodology

### Out of scope
Unrelated optimizations.

### Notes
Graphs, profiles, or references.
